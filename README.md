# 🏡 Predictive Modeling of Ames Housing Data (Simulated Version)

This project demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline for predicting house prices using a simulated version of the **Ames Housing dataset**. The workflow includes data simulation, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation — all within a single Jupyter notebook.

---

## 📌 Overview

The goal is to build and compare different regression models to predict the log-transformed house prices (`SalePrice`) based on important structural and neighborhood features.

Key steps covered:
- Simulating an Ames-like dataset
- Data cleaning and feature transformation
- Pipeline creation using Scikit-Learn
- Model comparison (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)
- Interpretation of Ridge Regression coefficients

## 📈 Dataset Description

The dataset used here is a **simulated subset** of the Ames Housing dataset. It mimics real-world property data with fields such as:

- `OverallQual`: Overall material and finish quality
- `GrLivArea`: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
- `GarageCars`: Size of garage in car capacity
- `LotFrontage`: Linear feet of street connected to property
- `Neighborhood`: Physical locations within Ames city
- `SalePrice`: Log-transformed sale price of the house (target)

---

## 🧪 Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression** (α = 10)
- **Lasso Regression** (α = 0.01)

Model performance is evaluated using:
- **Cross-validated R² Score**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **Ridge Regression** demonstrated the most robust and consistent performance across folds.
- Important predictors include `Neighborhood`, `HouseAge`, and `GrLivArea`.
- The notebook includes coefficient interpretation to explain model decisions.
